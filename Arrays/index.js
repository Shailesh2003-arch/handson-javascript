// Here we will discuss about arrays and important methods of arrays...
// Array is a homogenous as well as heterogenous mixture of elements, that means an array can hold data of same type as well as different type...

// For example:

// In javascript, arrays can store mixed data type like this...
const mixElements = [10, 20, 30, "Shailesh", true, false, NaN, ""];
console.log(mixElements);
